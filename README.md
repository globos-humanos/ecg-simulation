## 🫀 ECG Simulator for Medical Training

This project is an interactive ECG simulator designed specifically for medical students and clinicians, built to help understand, visualize, and revise electrocardiographic patterns in a practical, clinically relevant way.

Unlike basic waveform generators, this simulator focuses on real ECG behavior, allowing users to explore how different cardiac conditions, physiological changes, and external factors alter ECG morphology across leads.

### Intended Audience

- Medical students preparing for exams  
- Interns and residents revising ECG interpretation  
- Educators looking for a simple teaching aid  



## ✨ Key Features

- Interactive ECG waveform generation  
- Simulation of common and high-yield ECG patterns, including:
  - Rate and rhythm changes  
  - Axis deviations  
  - ST–T segment changes  
  - Conduction abnormalities  
- Lead-based visualization (clinically oriented, not abstract)  
- Simple, distraction-free interface focused on learning  



## 🎯 Educational Philosophy

The goal of this simulator is **conceptual clarity**, not just visual accuracy.  
Every change in the waveform reflects an underlying physiological or pathological principle, making it suitable for both quick revision and deeper understanding.

This project is part of a broader effort to create **practical, exam-oriented, and clinically grounded tools for medicos**, built by a doctor for doctors.



## 🚧 Project Status

This is an actively evolving project.

Planned improvements include:
- Additional pathological ECG patterns  
- Scenario-based simulations (e.g., electrolyte imbalance, drug effects)  
- Improved lead-specific correlations  

Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome.


## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This simulator is intended **for educational purposes only** and should not be used for clinical diagnosis or patient management.
